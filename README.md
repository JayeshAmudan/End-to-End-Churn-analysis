# 📘 Customer Churn Analysis – End-to-End Python Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end data analysis pipeline built in Python** to explore customer behavior and identify the key factors driving **customer churn**.

It focuses on:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visual storytelling to extract business insights

The analysis walks through the complete lifecycle — from a raw CSV dataset to **actionable insights**, making it a strong demonstration of practical data analysis skills using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Clean and preprocess real-world structured data
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover churn patterns
* Identify relationships between churn and key customer attributes, including:

  * Gender
  * Senior citizen status
  * Contract type
  * Tenure
  * Internet services
  * Payment methods
* Communicate insights clearly using charts and summary statistics

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Matplotlib** – data visualization
* **Seaborn** – statistical and comparative plots
* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – interactive analysis environment

## 📊 Sample Insights Generated

* A significant portion of customers have churned, indicating retention challenges
* **Month-to-month contracts** show the highest churn rates
* Customers with **shorter tenure** are more likely to churn
* **Payment method choice** has a noticeable impact on churn behavior
* **Senior citizens** exhibit different churn patterns compared to non-senior customers

These findings highlight how data analysis can directly support **business and retention strategy decisions**.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
* Perform feature engineering and correlation analysis
* Convert the notebook into reusable Python modules
* Build interactive dashboards using Plotly or Streamlit
