📘 README.md – Journal / Churn Analysis Project (Python)
📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis pipeline built in Python to explore customer behavior and identify key factors behind customer churn.
It focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual storytelling using industry-standard Python libraries.

The notebook walks through the full analysis lifecycle—from raw CSV data to actionable insights—making it a strong example of practical data analysis and visualization.

🎯 Objectives

-Clean and preprocess real-world structured data

-Explore customer churn patterns using visual analysis

-Identify relationships between churn and key variables such as:

-Gender

-Senior citizen status

-Contract type

-Tenure

-Internet services

-Payment methods

Present insights clearly using charts and summary statistics

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3

1) Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning

2) NumPy – numerical operations

3) Matplotlib – data visualization

3) Seaborn – statistical plots

4) Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – interactive analysis

🚀 Key Features

✔️ Data cleaning (handling missing values and type conversions)

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✔️ Clear visualizations:

      Count plots

      Pie charts

      Histograms

      Stacked bar charts

✔️ Feature-wise churn comparison

✔️ Business-focused interpretation of results



📊 Sample Insights Generated

- Overall churn percentage across the dataset

- Higher churn rates among month-to-month contracts

- Churn trends based on tenure length

- Impact of payment methods on churn

- Differences between senior citizens and non-senior customers

These insights demonstrate how data analysis can directly support business decision-making.

📈 Future Improvements

- Add predictive modeling (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)

- Feature engineering and correlation analysis

- Convert notebook into a reusable Python script

- Add interactive dashboards (Plotly / Streamlit)
